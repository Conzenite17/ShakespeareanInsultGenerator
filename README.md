# ShakespeareanInsultGenerator
QA Task to have an application that generates insults from lists of words all matching the same first letter

Current Version: 1.0

Version 1.0 Status:
A working program that loads in words from a text file into 3 drop down menues.
When the first word is selected the rest of the dropdowns get re-populated with only the words that start with the same letter as the first word
Finaly once the generate button is pressed the 3 words with be added to the text area as a 1 line insult

You can do this as many times as you wish.

Next Working Version: 1.1
Aim is to reDesign the UI as it is outdated and small for current systems

Future Plans:
- Be able to import the words from a database
- Save insults to a database
